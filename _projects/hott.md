__Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT)__ is an intuitionistic type theory which views types
as abstract, homotopy-invariant objects. As remarked in the HoTT book,
this correspondence is quite remarkable as it provides a link between
homotopy theory (which is related to algebraic topology, homological algebra, and higher category theory)
and type theory, a field of mathematical logic and theoretical computer science.
HoTT provides a type-theoretic foundation to
mathematics rather then the conventional set theoretic foundation.
This in turn, allows for proofs within HoTT to be formalized and
understood by a computer via a proof assistant.

During the summer of 2019, myself, Daniel Carranza, and Jonathan Chang, under the supervision of
Chris Kapulkin, began exploring the notion of __2-adjoint equivalences__ and coherences between types.
This resulted in the construction, proof, and formalization of many properties one would expect
from a 2-adjoint equivalence. The following summer the remaining properties were formalized by Daniel
Carranza. The final, formalized proofs were added to the
[HoTT in Lean 3 library](https://github.com/gebner/hott3) and can be found in
the [2adj](https://github.com/gebner/hott3/tree/master/src/hott/types/2_adj) directory.
Moreover, a [paper](https://lmcs.episciences.org/7124) describing the 2-adjoint equivalence and its formalization was
published to the journal of Logical Methods in Computer Science.

    Proving equality between types corresponds to showing there is a path between spaces (more specifically,
      that the path space is inhabited). We can also prove equality of path
      spaces by considering paths between paths, as we see in the first image, and equality of
      paths between paths by showing there is a path between paths between paths, as we
      see in the second image.
